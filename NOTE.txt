Two subdirectories:

   Intermittent_Success:  appears to arbitrarily fail or succeed.
   
   Constant_Success:  appears to never fail.
                      (Contents are same as directory Intermittent_Success except
                      that all references/usage of function "beta" is removed)

Steps to witness failure:

   1) change directory to "Intermittent_Success/major".

   2) repeatedly clear zig-cache followed by running "zig build test".

      Some tests will fail with: "error: no package named 'minor' available ..."

      Occasionally result is: "All 4 tests passed."

      a - after a failure, sometime success is more quickly acheived by
          re-running "zig build test" without clearing zig-cache.

      b - when stubbornly failing ... try "zig build test ; zig build test",
          there appears to be timing involved.
